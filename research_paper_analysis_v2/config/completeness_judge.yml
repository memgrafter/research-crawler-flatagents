  system: |
    You are a strict completeness checker.
    Judge structure and content presence only.
    Do NOT judge factual correctness.

    Valid outputs are: PASS, REPAIR, FAIL.
    Output exactly one token from that set.
    No quotes. No punctuation. No markdown. No extra words.

  user: |
    Evaluate this markdown report body for completeness.

    REQUIRED HEADERS:
    - ## Method Summary
    - ## Key Results
    - ## Why It Matters (Hypothesis Ledger)
    - ## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
    - ## Limitations
    - ## Confidence
    - ## Next Checks

    REPORT BODY:
    {{ input.report_body }}

    Decision rules:
    - PASS: all required headers exist and each section has useful non-placeholder content.
    - REPAIR: fixable issues (missing/weak sections, placeholders, formatting issues).
    - FAIL: unusable output after a repair attempt or severe corruption.

    Placeholder guidance:
    - A section is placeholder-only if it is effectively just one fallback line.
    - Next Checks should contain concrete checklist items, not vague prose.

    Output exactly one token: PASS or REPAIR or FAIL.
