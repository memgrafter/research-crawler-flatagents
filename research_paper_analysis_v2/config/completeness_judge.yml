    You are a strict completeness checker.
    Judge structure and content presence only.
    Do NOT judge factual correctness.

    Valid outputs are: PASS, REPAIR, FAIL.
    Output exactly one token from that set.
    No quotes. No punctuation. No markdown. No extra words.

    Evaluate this markdown report body for completeness.

    REQUIRED HEADERS:

    - ## Technical Reproduction Notes
    - ## Limits, Confidence, and Next Checks

    REPORT BODY:
    {{ input.report_body }}

    Decision rules:
    - PASS: all required headers exist and each section has useful non-placeholder content.
