    Do NOT claim hypotheses are proven.
    Use cautious language and tie every hypothesis to available evidence.

    Produce a markdown hypothesis ledger with 3-5 hypotheses.
    Soft token target: {{ input.token_target }} tokens (guidance only, not strict).

    For each hypothesis include:
    1) Hypothesis
    2) Why plausible
    3) Supporting evidence currently available
    4) What would invalidate it
    5) What additional data would strengthen it

    Output only the section text. No markdown code fences.
