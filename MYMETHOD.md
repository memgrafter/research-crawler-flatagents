# My Method for generating new agent nets

This is a handwritten method so I can reduce and automate this later.

1. Copy relevant examples from flatagents python sdk examples over.
2. Copy examples/ README.md over.



## Goals

- Rely on the flatagents bundled MACHINES.md and README.md for machine context. 
    - Can the coding "agent" worker find it? E.g. codex, claude code, antigravity.
